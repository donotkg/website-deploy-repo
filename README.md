# Website Deployment Automation (CI/CD Pipeline)

This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a static website using a CI/CD pipeline.  
Each time developers push code to the repository, the pipeline automatically rebuilds and deploys the updated website.

## 🚀 Objective

- Remove manual deployment steps
- Speed up delivery of website changes
- Ensure consistent and automated deployment
- Show understanding of DevOps CI/CD concepts

This project simulates a real DevOps workflow where every commit triggers a full automated deployment process.

## 🧩 Features

- Automatic pipeline trigger on every push  
- Static website build step  
- Deployment step to a hosting environment (ex: S3, static server, or GitHub Pages)  
- Version-controlled infrastructure  
- Clean and simple folder structure
