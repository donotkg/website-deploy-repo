# website-deploy-repo

Website Deployment Automation 

Your team needs an automated solution to deploy a static website. Developers currently have to deploy manually every time they want to test new updates, which slows down their workflow. The goal of this project is to set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that deploys the website to an S3-hosted static site whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Once the pipeline is configured, developers will simply commit updates to the Git repository, and the pipeline will automatically rebuild and redeploy the site. You will also validate the setup by making a small change to the code to confirm that the deployment triggers correctly and that the updated site becomes available through the static URL.
